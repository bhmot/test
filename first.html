         Computer science is an entirely cumulative field of study.
         That means, each successive topic builds off prior topics.
         If you have previously attempted to learn programming
         (or any STEM field) in school, tried your best,
         but failed — you weren’t the problem.
         A good professor of any cumulative subject
         carefully curates the curriculum. Provided that each 
         student has sufficiently prepared and satisfied the
         prerequisites, the expectations for the students’ prior
         knowledge should be clear. A good professor understands 
         the expectations and assumes no knowledge beyond that scope.
         Anything outside of the expectations must be taught.
         Each topic in the curriculum is ordered sequentially,
         respective to the other topics.<br>
         When a subject is cumulative, meticulous attention must
         be paid when designing a course curriculum or learning path.
         With that said, don’t choose a language for its ranking;
         choose a language for which you have a complete learning
         path that makes no assumptions about prior knowledge</P>
